    <p>
      <strong>Adobo</strong> is critically acclaimed the national dish of the
      Philippines. It is a meat-based dish usually marinated in a sauce
      containing vinegar, garlic, and soy sauce. Every region of the country has
      their own recipe for the dish, but two ingredients are common for all --
      vinegar and soy sauce. It is one of the easiest dishes to serve and is
      cost-efficient.

    <ul>
      <li>Meat of choice (Pork or Chicken)</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Peppercorn (whole)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        (Optional) Marinate the pork belly in soy sauce and crushed garlic. It
        is best to marinate it overnight. If time is limited, one hour should be
        enough. Some like to add vinegar during the process. You may do so if
        preferred.
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If marinated, drain the pork with the some of the marinade to a
            boiling pot. Save the remaining marinade for later.
          </li>
          <li>
            If not marinated, put the pork in pot with water (fill water until
            half of the pork body is submerged). Wait until it boils.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If marinated, add bay leaves and peppercorn. Add vinegar to taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            If not marinated, add garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorn when the
            water boils. Add vinegar and soy sauce to taste
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sugar to taste when the pork releases its oil. The taste should be
        sour with a bit of sweetness from the sugar and soy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Serve when the pork is brown and tender. Preferably with rice!</li>
