      <strong>Halo-halo</strong> is a native dessert of the Philippines. It
      literally translates into <em>"mix"</em> or
      <em>"mixed together".</em> This dessert is very simple to serve. Crush
      some ice, add the ingredients, top it with "Leche Flan" and "Ube". It's
      notoriously famous since Philippines is a tropical country and it's always
      generally hot. That doesn't mean you can't eat it when it's cold though
      --trust me, we eat it even when it's raining.
