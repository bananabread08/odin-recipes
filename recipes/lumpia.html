      <strong>Lumpia</strong> or <strong>Lumpiang Shanghai</strong> is a type of
      Filipino snack and the closest depiction of it is a spring roll. The basic
      filling is composed of ground pork along with minced onions, carrots, and
      seasonings such as salt and ground black pepper. Lumpia is probably the
      most famous <em>handa</em> (food that is served in special occassions) in
      every Filipino gathering. As the saying goes, the party is never complete
      if there is no Lumpia.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ground Pork (1 kg)</li>
      <li>Carrots (half-cup for every vegatable)</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Cabbage</li>
      <li>Black Pepper (ground, 1 teaspoon)</li>
      <li>Salt (1 teaspoon)</li>
      <li>Soy Sauce (1 teaspoon)</li>
      <li>Cooking Oil</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>Lumpia Wrapper (can use spring roll wrapper)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice the Carrots (diced), Garlic (diced), and Cabbage (sliced thinly).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a wok or large skillet over high heat, and pour in 1 tablespoon
        vegetable oil. Cook pork, stirring frequently, until no pink is showing.
        Remove pork from pan and set aside. Drain grease from pan, leaving a
        thin coating. Cook garlic and onion in the same pan for 2 minutes. Stir
        in the cooked pork, carrots, green onions, and cabbage. Season with
        pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce. Remove from heat, and set
        aside until cool enough to handle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place three heaping tablespoons of the filling diagonally near one
        corner of each wrapper, leaving a 1 1/2 inch space at both ends. Fold
        the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both
        ends, and roll neatly. Keep the roll tight as you assemble. Moisten the
        other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Cover the rolls
        with plastic wrap to retain moisture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add oil to 1/2 inch depth, and
        heat for 5 minutes. Slide 3 or 4 lumpia into the oil. Fry the rolls for
        1 to 2 minutes, until all sides are golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately while it's hot. Sauce choices:
        <ul>
          <li>Vinegar with diced garlic and onion (personal fave!)</li>
          <li>Ketchup or Tabasco Sauce.</li>
          <li>Melted Cheese also works!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
